This is my finishing project for the first semester at Noroff.

## Description

I was tasked with designing and building a site for an interactive science museum, where children where the target audience. 
The project should reflect my creative and technical knowledge and skills based on the first semester curriculum. It was built using only html and css.

Requirements:

- The site must be have a design that appeals to the target audience
- The site must have at least 4-6 pages
- Compositional principles, typography, and color schemes must be considered
- Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented
- The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle
- The site should download quickly, and not be overly "heavy". Images should not be over 200kb
- The site should take WCAG principles into consideration, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation, and color usage
- The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on a variety of devices
- The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of meta tags and alt text)

Thoughts:

Although there is a lot of room for improvement, I'm happy with the progress I made from my first project. The biggest difference was that I had 
the coding part in mind when I designed the site, knowing my limitations and what I found difficult. I also improved on DRY principle, focusing on
reusable class elements.
